# Norman

Hi, I'm artist and coder [James Paterson](https://www.instagram.com/presstube/).

Norman is the beginnings of an animation tool I’ve always wanted. I built it in JavaScript, it runs in a web browser, and lets me animate naturally in 3D using VR controllers.

* Check out the [project site](https://normanvr.com/#bts).
* Watch an [animated short](https://normanvr.com/#animatedshort) made entirely with Norman.
* Watch the [making of](https://normanvr.com/#bts) Norman.

To use Norman in its current form you’ll need an Oculus Rift, and to clone/run the code locally. A more comprehensive, user-friendly experience is in the works.

However, you can also view & play with Norman animations at the top of [normanvr.com](https://normanvr.com) using a viewer created by [Dan Motzenbecker](https://github.com/dmotz). Check out Dan's viewer source code [here](https://github.com/googlecreativelab/norman-sketch-player).

A proper README with instructions is coming soon, but for now... A bunch of GIFS!
